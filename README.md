# Caesar Cypher Email Script                                 
This program allows the user to read a password from a file, that password will then be sent through a caesar cypher, the encrypted password will then be decrypted, and then it will be sent used to login to a gmail account to send a email to any given email address. This project will not work until you add your own code to the password.txt file. I will leave this blank for passwords to be added accordingly.

## Why did I do this project.
I wanted to learn a little bit about networking and cybersecurity. I wanted to spread my horizon and look into different types of programming.

# Development Environment

I used the python programming language.
I used gmail to test the emails being sent.
I also used txt files to save passwords and email body texts.

# Future Work
* I plan on adding more to the script to allow images to be sent via email.
* Send a single email to multiple different emails.
* Grab key words from sent emails and add conditionals on if key words are there.
